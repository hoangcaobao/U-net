# U-net

I use TensorFlow framework to create U-net deep learning model to detect knee position in X-ray image. You can detect other parts when you provide data in data folder. 

The architecture was created by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).

## Overview

### Dataset

My dataset contain 2 types: X-ray image and its knee position as label. Here is an example of my dataset:
